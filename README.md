# Trella
## A Trello Inspired Practice Land
Armed with strong HTML & CSS experience but little to no background in actual code, Nicolas is on a journey to become a front-end developer. Follow him as he learn and expand his knowledge of loops, components and countless novel programming terminologies. His first act in this unknown land is to gather the powerful language of Vue.js. Thought by his master Sofiane, helped by Philippe and endured by Jean-Fran√ßois, who knows where this will lead him?
